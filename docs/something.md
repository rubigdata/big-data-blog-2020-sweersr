# More about me!

Next to being an enthusiastic student, I am the bass player of a band called [Sarah Jurassica Parker](https://sarahjurassicaparker.bandcamp.com/), have a listen!

Next to making music, I like to take long walks (not necessarily on the beach) and to cook.

I'm taking this course for a few reasons, but mostly to learn some new and usefull skills.
