# Streaming from home!

In this weeks blogpost we take a look at Spark Structured Streaming. I learned how to process data from an artificially created data stream of the [RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com/community) market in Apache Zeppelin. 

## The DataStream

The data stream used in this assignment as mentioned before isn't an actual data stream but one generated but one generated by a python script. The script randomly generates items that are "sold" within the game of RuneScape, all datapoints are presented  as Strings formatted as follows: "<Material> <Item> was sold for <price>gp." The first thing to do to proces the stream is actually reading it, this is done easily with:
  
  ```scala
  val socketDF = spark.readStream
  .format("socket")
  .option("host", "0.0.0.0")
  .option("port", 9999)
  .load()
  ```
